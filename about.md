I'm a sofware engineer currently living in Stockholm and working at [Qapital](http://www.qapital.com). I spend most of my time writing code in <code><span class="orange">Swift</span></code> and <code><span class="orange">Objective-C</span></code> looking to build cool products. I love [Open source](https://github.com/damirstuhec) and try to be helpful on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1677480/damirstuhec?tab=profile). I'm passionate about design, music, sports, food and traveling. <a href="/contact/">Say hello!</a>
